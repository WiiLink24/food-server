    Nintendo makes questionable decisions. This is a fact.
    Some of them one may consider somewhat justified, based on development
    time and constraint.

    Consider the following C pseudocode:

    int index = 0;
    int count = GetChildNodeCount(responseNode);
    while (index < count - 1) {
      // [...]
    }

    Nintendo loops through the count of all response codes.
    As having apiStatus -> code and version normally
    would mean response has a child count of 2 and other restaurants,
    they violate every XML standard known to humankind and parse it separately.

    It would not hurt them to have put the data inside of a separate node.
    It would not hurt them to subtract 2 should they require "response" for unknown standards.
    Even worse, this is Wii-specific, as none of their mobile applications
    (iPhone OS 3.1 or Android 2.2, earliest found) rely on any of this functionality.
    Yet, here we are.

    We append such manually, as they use this syntax in multiple locations.
